# Stripecon Lightning Talk 2022: CMS Preview - beyond the documentation

## Done

- Basic examples from documentation
  - On a page (Books Page)
  - In a ModelAdmin (Product Admin)
  - Model as a Page (Region Admin)
- Example that can be previewed from a modeladmin OR on a page (Property Admin & Property Page)
- Preview a PDF which is generated on-the-fly (Pdf Admin -> PDF Templates)
- Preview objects in a ModelAdmin directly from the gridfield (Pdf Admin)
- Preview relations of an object from a js-injected dropdown (Pdf Admin -> Clients)

## Stretch goals

- set up fixtures so others can easily spin up the demonstrations if they want
  - Maybe use https://github.com/chrispenny/silverstripe-data-object-to-fixture
- Make the demonstrations look nice (theming)
- Add lots of nice documentation in the code (phpdocs mostly) to help people navigate the examples
