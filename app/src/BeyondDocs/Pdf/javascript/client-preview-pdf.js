    You obviously would want to put this in a more appropriate place for your project.
    In this case I've put it here because I want it to be REALLY clear what code goes with what functionality.
    So keeping it together with the PHP makes it a lot easier for this demo code.

  TODO
  On click for button.js-client-preview-pdfs:
    Get URL from data-preview-url on the button
    Get the first PDF from the available PDFs
    Append its ID to the URL and tell the preview panel to use it
    Add a dropdown to the preview panel with all the PDFs
    Expand preview panel
    Change button text to "Close PDFs"
  On change for the PDFs dropdown in the preview panel:
    Append the pdf ID to the URL and tell the preview panel to use it
  On click of close PDFs button:
    Probably just collapse the panel again?
    Change button text to what it was at the start
